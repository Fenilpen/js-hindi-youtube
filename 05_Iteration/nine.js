// example in . reduce 

// const array = [10,20,30,40,50]

// let sum = array.reduce( (acc,curr ) => acc + curr, 0 )
// console.log(sum);


// At the end lets compere three methods foreach, filter, reduce


// 1. forEach

// Purpose: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
// Usage: Useful for performing side effects, such as logging, on each element of an array.
// Returns: Undefined.

// 2. filter

// Purpose: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
// Usage: Useful for filtering out elements that meet certain criteria.
// Returns: A new array with elements that pass the test.

// 3. reduce

// Purpose: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
// Usage: Useful for accumulating a value based on the array elements, such as summing numbers or combining objects.
// Returns: A single value.
