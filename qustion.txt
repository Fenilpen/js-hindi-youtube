basic qustions and notes regarding javascript

() = parentheses
{} = curly brackets
[] = square brackets

qustion 1
what is the diffrence bitween .txt files and .js files
answer :-
the diffrence bitween .js files and .txt files is that both are allmost same, 
the reason is that we can treat both files as source files
meanwhile both contains text but in .js file the text is not random text 
they have their own sturcture,syntext and meaning 
every programing langauage come with their own syantex .js , .py etc

.js / .py extention can help to compile code with their own systex and meaning
.txt dont have any compiler and we needcompiler to execute our code
if we write var/let in txt its just a alphabetical word with no meaning
but with extention .js/.py it has it own meaning its called the keyword

Notes from the series:-

No - 4 (Variables)
prefer not to use var 
beacause of the issue in block scope and functional scope


No - 5 (dataTypes,newjs)
"use strict"  it will treat all javascript code as newer version    (newer version of javascript)


datatypes in javascript:-

there are two types of datatypes

1 Primitive dataTypes  and Non-Primitive datatypes :-

number  => 234
bigint => 2 power 4
string =>  "in this"
boolean => true , false
null
undefined
symbol => something unique

Non-Primitive datatypes (Reference)

Array
object
function
non-Primitive's Typeof is function , object

note 
1 if you want to master javascript master javascript objects and browser's web-events.
2 Javascriptis dynamicaly typed langauage. it means type of variable is determined at runtime.


No - 6 Datatype Conversion

// "33" => 33    /string to number
// "33fenil" => NaN    /string to number   (becuase its not pure number so its NaN (not a number))
// true => 1; false => 0   /number to boolean and vice versa
// "" => false   /string to boolean
// "fvds" => true  /string to boolean


No-7 Strings method


No-8
