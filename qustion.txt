basic qustion regarding javascript

qustion 1
what is the diffrence bitween .txt files and .js files
answer :-
the diffrence bitween .js files and .txt files is that both are allmost same, 
the reason is that we can treat both files as source files
meanwhile both contains text but in .js file the text is not random text 
they have their own sturcture,syntext and meaning 
every programing langauage come with their own syantex .js , .py etc
.js / .py extention can help to compile code with their own systex and meaning
.txt dont have any compiler and we needcompiler to execute our code
