Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. 
It allows scripts and programs to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of documents.

Key Features of the DOM
Dynamic Access: JavaScript can change all HTML elements on a page.
Manipulation: Elements can be added, removed, or modified.
Event Handling: JavaScript can react to user events like clicks or key presses.

Common Methods for Manipulating the DOM :-
JavaScript provides several methods to interact with the DOM:
Selecting Elements:
getElementById(id): Selects an element by its ID.
getElementsByClassName(className): Selects elements by their class name.
getElementsByTagName(tagName): Selects elements by their tag name.
querySelector(selector): Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
Traversing Nodes:
parentNode: Accesses the parent node of an element.
childNodes: Retrieves all child nodes of an element.
nextSibling: Accesses the next sibling node.

// Visual Representation
// To further illustrate how the DOM works, hereâ€™s a diagram showing a simple representation of the relationships between different nodes in a DOM tree:
