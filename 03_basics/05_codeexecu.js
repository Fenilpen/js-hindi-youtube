// javascript execution context
// in first step your code will go for in global execution

// now what is global and this meant??

// in JavaScript, the global execution context is the default environment where code is executed. 
// Itâ€™s the context that is created when your JavaScript file starts running, 
// and it sets the stage for all the code that follows.

// Global Object: In a web browser, this is the window object. 
// It provides access to built-in functions, objects, and variables.

// this Keyword: In the global context, 
// this refers to the global object (window in browsers)

// the global execution context could be diffent in browser and your runtime environment

// we have three execution context
// global execution 
// functional executional context
// eval execution context

// Functional Execution Context
// you can think of the functional execution context as a new variable environment
// though this is a simplified way to describe this
// Definition: This context is created whenever a function is called. 
// Each function call creates a new functional execution context.

// Characteristics:
// It handles the execution of that specific function.
// The functional execution context contains its own this value, variables, and object properties.
// It is pushed to the top of the execution stack, and once the function is done executing, it is popped off the stack.

// // these things will run in two phases
// in global execution =>
// 1 Memory creation phase (memory allocation for variables) =>
// 2 execution phase (values get defines)

// lets learn with example
// here is the sample code

// let val1 = 10
// let val2 = 5

// function addNum(num1 , num2){
//     return num1 + num2
// }

// let result1 = addNum(val1,val2)
// let result2 = addNum(10,2)


// first step towords execution

// 1 code will go in global execution context (this)

// 2 memory phase
// it will take all variables with undefined value
//
// val1 = undefined
// val2 = undefined
// addNum = defination
// result1 = undefined
// result2 = undefined

// 3 execution phase
// val1 = 10
// val2 = 5
//
// addNum [it will create new executional context] //for every function it will create new exec context
// [new variable environment + executional thread]  // functional execution context
// memoryphase and execution phase
// val1 = undefined
// val2 = undefined
// total = undefined
//  
// executional context (prossesing)
// num1 = 10
// num2 = 5
// total = 15
// return total
// 
// [delete executional context]


// call stack

// what is call stack in javascript ???

// The call stack in JavaScript is a mechanism for keeping track of function calls. 
// It's a stack data structure that operates in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.
// meaning the last function that gets pushed onto the stack is the first to be popped off when it completes execution

// Here's a quick rundown on how it works:
// When you call a function, it gets pushed onto the top of the call stack.
// When the function finishes executing, it's popped off the stack.
// This process continues until the stack is empty.
